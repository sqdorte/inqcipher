# Incipher

Inqcipher is a python implementation of the [inqcipher wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvsiLV7RLx4), or the mexican army cipher wheel.
It can be configured to use a custom charset, and even more than just 4 "levels" (in the original mexican army cipher wheel, there are only 4 possible ways of encoding a single character on the charset).

There's also a command line wrapper to the functions in `incipher.py`. You can find it at `main.py`.

### Configuration

You can set your own charset and configure how many levels to use in `config.json`.
